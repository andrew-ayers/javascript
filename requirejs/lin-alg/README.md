# Linear Algebra Library Test-Bed #

### About ###

Just a test-bed for a simple, custom linear algebra library. I may
use the resulting library in a future project...

It's based on the RequireJS Single Page Application template. You
won't find anything special or new in this library, as it's more a 
way for me to learn how to use RequireJS in a semi-real project,
than anything else.

# Bookmarklet: Instructable Cleaner++ #

### About ###

Have you ever wanted to save a favorite Instructable as PDF, or download a clean copy without all of the "extras" that just get in the way of everything? Well, then this bookmarklet is for you!

I've had a version of this bookmarklet floating around on my system for quite a few years. There was always something not quite "done" with it, though, and recently after using it, I decided to fix a few of those problems.

Then I thought that maybe others might want to use it, too, and it was in good enough shape for general use that I said to myself, "Let's throw it up on github!"

I'm not going to claim it is perfect; I'm sure there are still bugs and issues with it (probably in the PDF export and printing department), but believe me when I say it's much better than it was!

### How to Use ###

1. Download the "instructable-cleaner++.js" file (or view the raw version)
2. Open the file, then highlight the code and "select all"
3. Create a new bookmark in your browser; name it something like "Instructable Cleaner++"
4. Paste the code you selected in step 2 into the "URL" field for the bookmark
5. Save the bookmark

Once done, just browse to an [Instructable](https://instructables.com/), and scroll to the bottom (this is to force any "lazy-loading" of data - particularly pictures and comments). 

Then, click on the saved Instructable Cleaner bookmarklet, and see the "magic". You can then print it, save it, export it to a PDF...whatever you want!

### Future Updates? ###

1. Fix any remaining issues (printing, PDF export)
2. Create a commented version of the code
3. Implement a better regex checking method

I want to note that the code isn't commented because that would just increase the size of the bookmarklet when you cut and pasted it; the code is fairly easy to follow as-is, though.

What I'd like to do is maybe create something to generate a "condensed" version of the javascript (removing comments, spaces, etc), perhaps in Bash, that can be run on the source code and output an easy-to-cut-n-paste single line. Now that I think about it, someone else has probably created such a tool...
